                    Millions of pixels are created every day. We believe that millions of new pieces of music can be
                    generated
                    to allow a wider audience to appreciate the vast treasure trove of satellite data we have available
                    today.

                </p>
                <p>
                    SongSAT is a global award-winning tool to share the beauty of the world in different mediums,
                    expressing the wonders of
                    satellite imagery through audio. This allows the beauty of satellite imagery to communicate to an
                    audience
                    with visual impairments to enjoy the wonders of the world from above too, or to be used by
                    musicians to
                    aid
                    with musical writing blocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our team produced an algorithm, SongSAT, to convert five distinct geographical areas (Arctic, Grasslands,
                    Forest, Coastal/Water areas, and Mountainous regions) into songs with distinct, recognizable musical
                    patterns that play back using MIDI.

                </p>
                <h5 style="margin-top: 40px;">How SongSAT Works</h5>
                <h2>Simplified Explanation</h2>
                <p>
                    SongSAT determines the most common landcover type in a LandSAT image to determine what style of music it generates.
                    For instance, if an image is mainly covered with agricultural fields and a small lake, SongSAT will translate the
                    image into rural-themed music. This is achieved by translating each pixel's (the small squares that make
                    up an image) digital number into notes. This process takes the remainder of the pixel's digital number (0-255) divided by the
                    number of notes in a scale. Hence, if the theme uses a C major scale, it would divide the pixel value by 8 and
                    take the remainder. If the remainder is 0, it would play a C. If the remainder is 1, it would play a D,
                    and so forth. <br>
                    <br>
                    These generated outputs are converted into playable sheet music, which is then brought into a music
                    software that can play the music back.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're proud to announce that this algorithm is 100% open source, and you can view the code at:

            <h5 style="text-align: center;">How SongSAT Works</h5>
            <h1>Advanced Explanation</h1>
            <div class="about-product">
                The first thing SongSAT does is determine what the predominant land class the image is. To do this,
                we sample 400 points on the input image and extract the land class at these sample locations from
                the <a href="http://glcf.umd.edu/data/lc/">Global Land Cover Facility MODIS dataset</a>. We also
                compare to see if any points fall in any mountainous regions, using <a
                    href="https://www.unep-wcmc.org/resources-and-data/mountains-and-forests-in-mountains">
                    a dataset provided by the United Nations</a>, since the MODIS dataset does not have mountains
                as a land cover classification. If the majority of the points fall within mountainous pixels, it
                returns mountainous as the land cover classification, otherwise it will return the dominant land
                cover class fount from the MODIS dataset. <br><br>

                In order to have music that represents the landscape, a bit of human intervention was needed to
                guide the algorithm in the right direction. We are working to support all land cover types, and have
                successfully created five of the seven dominant land classes (Mountain, water, rural, forest, and arctic
                have been created, with desert and urban remaining to be created). <br><br>

                Each theme has a corresponding set of notes that it can play (The water theme uses a pentatonic
                scale, the mountain theme uses a combination of semitone clusters and a variation on the minor
                scale, and the other two use variations on the major scale), and each theme also has a set of
                rhythms for the two voices in the melody to use that are selected at random. SongSAT takes the
                modulus of each pixel value to simplify the 0-255 range of the pixel down to the number of notes in
                the selected scale, and then maps the new value, which is the degree of the scale, to the
                corresponding note in that scale. To make a pleasing accompaniment, the first note of the bar
                selected in the melody is made the note for the accompaniment for that bar, with the accompaniment
                switching octaves on each note change to add movement and variation to it. Forest however uses a
                sixteenth note arpeggiating baseline and mountain uses an aggressive syncopated rhythm instead of a
                simple octave switching to better match the mood of the area. All these values are written to a
                MIDI file as output. As well, to keep the melody line flowing and not disjointed, it ensures that
                no jumps larger than a perfect fifth occur (For example, if the interval is from C to A, it will
                choose to go down a major third instead of up a major sixth). <br><br>

                The MIDI file at the end was then brought into MuseScore, a free and open source notation software
                to select more appropriate instruments that fit the mood of the piece. The forest theme uses the
                default harp sound that ships with MuseScore, while the rest were instruments chosen from a
                third-party soundfont file to make the songs sound better and slightly less artificial.

            <div class="about-product">
                <p>
                    If our team chooses to pursue improving SongSAT, the next thing to do would be to add the remaining
                    land classification themes to allow for global coverage of SongSAT, and to add more rhythm options
                    to the songs to make it feel a bit less monotonous and repetitive, and possibly add in multiple
                    sections to the songs generated. After these key parts to it are improved, the next step after that
                    would be to make the program more user-friendly and accessible so that anyone can install and run
                    it, or make it into a proper web application that generates the music on the fly.
